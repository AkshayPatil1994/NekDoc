#[Nek5000 Documentation](http://nek5000.mcs.anl.gov/)

This is the repository of the Nek5000 documenation written in LaTex.

## How to build

'make all' builds both the user documentation as well as the developer
documentation

'make Nek_doc' and 'make Nek_users' builds the developer and user documentation, 
respectively.

## How to contribute

Please create a fork of the repository and make pull/merge requests. Keep in 
mind that number of binary files should be kept minimal. The Makefile should be 
adapted to any special build requirements.

And new issues are welcome to be reported.
